# AI-Statement
During this project, AI tools (such as LLMs, coding agents) were used as a support tool throughout development. They helped with drafting boiler-plate code, clarifying concepts from the lectures, exploring configuration options, and assisting with debugging and testing, and produce documentation. 

All AI-generated suggestions were reviewed, modified, and validated by the team before use. The final design decisions, implementations, and documentation are our own, and we take full responsibility for the correctness and quality of the project.
